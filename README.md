## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```env
URL=http://localhost:3000/
SUPABASE_URL=your supabase URL
SUPABASE_KEY=your generated API key for supabase

## Explanation of Supabase and Deepseek

### Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides developers with tools to build scalable applications. It offers features such as authentication, real-time databases, storage, and serverless functions. In this project, Supabase is used to manage collections such as `NPCS`, `COMBATS`, `INITIATIVES`, and `ITEMS`.

### Deepseek

[Deepseek](https://deepseek.com/) is an API-based service that provides advanced search and data analysis capabilities. It allows developers to integrate powerful search functionality into their applications. In this project, Deepseek is used to perform searches and data queries, with the `DEEPSEEK_URL` and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variables enabling access to its API.

## How This Project Uses Supabase and Deepseek

### Supabase Usage

This project leverages Supabase to manage and store data in collections. The following collections are utilized:

- **NPCS**: Stores data related to non-player characters (NPCs) in the RPG.
- **COMBATS**: Tracks combat scenarios and their associated details.
- **INITIATIVE**: Manages the initiative order for characters during combat.
- **ITEMS**: Contains information about items available in the game.

Supabase's APIs are used for CRUD operations on these collections, ensuring seamless data management and integration with the application.

This schema defines the structure of the `INITIATIVE` collection and is used to manage turn order and related data during combat scenarios in the RPG.

For all tables you should run:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for all users" 
ON public.npcs/itens/initiatives/combats
FOR INSERT 
TO public 
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for all users" 
ON public.npcs/itens/initiatives/combats
FOR DELETE 
TO public 
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Enable update for all users" 
ON public.npcs/itens/initiatives/combats
FOR UPDATE 
TO public 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Deepseek Usage

Deepseek is integrated into this project to provide advanced search and data analysis capabilities. It is used to:

- Perform complex searches across the game's data, such as finding specific NPCs, and items.
- Analyze data to provide insights or recommendations based on user queries.
